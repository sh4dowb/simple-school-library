# simple-school-library

Tested under:

- Apache 2 on Linux Mint 17
- PHP 7.0
- MySQL 5.7


Import database.sql, edit database.php, move the files to your webserver directory, and have fun!

This project was created because other library management systems wasn't simple enough, or didn't have a few features we wanted, so I made this one.

- Lightweight
- (Almost) no installation
- Unbelievably simple to use
